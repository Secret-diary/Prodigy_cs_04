# Simple Keylogger

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device designed to monitor and record keystrokes typed on a computer keyboard. Keyloggers are commonly used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity, parental control, or forensic investigation. However, they can also be deployed maliciously by attackers to capture sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal messages, without the user's knowledge or consent.

## Overview

This Python code uses the pynput.keyboard library to create a simple keylogger. It listens for keyboard events, writes the pressed keys to a log file named keylog.txt, and formats the output for readability.
